Build-Conflicts: libnewt-pic [mipsel]
Build-Depends:
# Base build dependencies:
	debhelper (>= 7.0.0),
#		Of course.
	apt (>= 0.8.16),
# 		Used for downloading udebs.
	apt-utils,
# 		apt-ftparchive is used for including localudebs.
	gnupg,
#		New versions of apt need gnupg for security checks.
	debian-archive-keyring (>= 2006.11.22),
#		To provide the archive key for security checks.
	dctrl-tools,
#		Various manipulations of the udeb Packages files.
	wget,
#		Used to test validity of mirrors.
	bc,
#		Used for some image size calculations.
	debiandoc-sgml,
#		partman's manual is in debiandoc.
	xsltproc,
	docbook-xml,
	docbook-xsl,
#		The d-i internals manual is in DocBook XML.
	libbogl-dev,
#		For bdftobogl used in font reduction.
#	
# Library build dependencies:
	libslang2-pic (>= 2.0.6-4),
#		Make dependency versioned temporarily to make sure we avoid #392942
	libnewt-pic (>= 0.52.2-11.3) [!mipsel],
#		Rather than use slang and newt udebs, reduced versions of
#		the libraries are put onto images to save space.
	libnewt-dev (>= 0.52.2-11.3) [mipsel],
#		On mipsel, we can't use libnewt-pic right now due to bug
#		#329733. See also Build-Conflicts above.
	libgcc1 [i386 amd64],
#		On x86 we need to include /lib/libgcc_s.so.1 in g-i initrds to
#		work around #373253 until upstream can remove pthread_cancel()
#		calls in directfb. For now, this is done by setting EXTRAFILES.
# 
# Filesystem tools:
	genext2fs (>= 1.3-7.1),
#		For creating ext2 filesystems without being root.
#		1.3-7.1 fixes issues on several arches.
	e2fsprogs,
#		genext2fs doesn't produce perfect filesystems, so we fsck
#		them.
#		Lintian: Yes, we know it's essential. We prefer not to
#		count on it remaining so.
	mklibs (>= 0.1.40), mklibs-copy (>= 0.1.40),
#		We use mklibs for library reduction.
	genisoimage [!s390 !s390x],
#		For making mini isos.
	genromfs [sparc sparc64],
#		Used for creating sparc floppies (which are not built by
#		default.)
	hfsutils [powerpc],
#		For making bootable HFS USB sticks for powerpc.
	dosfstools [i386 m68k amd64 armhf arm64],
#		For creating FAT filesystems with mkfs.msdos.
#		Of course i386/amd64 use this for floppies, CDs etc.
#		m68k uses it for atari floppies
#		armhf uses it for building bootable SD card images
	cpio,
#		For creating initramfs images.
	xz-utils,
#		For compressing initramfs images.
	devio [armeb armel],
#		Tool to read and write from block devices, used to byteswap
#		kernels and add nslu2 boot magic.
	slugimage (>= 0.10+r58-6) [armeb armel],
#		For building nslu2 firmware images.
	dns323-firmware-tools (>= 0.7.3-1~) [armel],
#		For building firmware images for the D-Link DNS-32(0|3).
	u-boot-tools [armel armhf],
#		For creating u-boot images
# 
# Boot loaders:
#	On many arches boot loaders are copied onto or ran on the boot
#	images in one way or another. There's a reason our mailing list is
#	still called debian-boot..
	syslinux [i386 amd64],
	syslinux-utils [i386 amd64],
	isolinux [i386 amd64],
	pxelinux [i386 amd64],
	syslinux-common (>= 3:6) [i386 amd64],
#		With isohybrid.
	yaboot [powerpc],
#		For all our powerpc boot needs. Well, not really.
	aboot (>= 0.9b-2) [alpha],
#		A previous version didn't have netabootwrap.
	silo [sparc sparc64],
#		Using silo is problematic since it needs to run as root,
#		so images that need it are not built by default, but we
#		include it for completeness.
	sparc-utils [sparc sparc64],
#		For elftoaout and piggyback, to make netboot images.
	atari-bootstrap [m68k],
#		Booting and other tools for Atari systems.
	vmelilo [m68k],
	m68k-vme-tftplilo [m68k],
#		For VME machines, although it doesn't yet support running
#		as non-root, the install will try to use it and fall back
#		to a warning when it fails.
	amiboot [m68k],
#		Bootloader for m68k/amiga machines.
	emile [m68k],
	emile-bootblocks [m68k],

#		U-boot binaries for armhf systems without u-boot in flash memory
	u-boot (>= 2016.01+dfsg1-1~) [armel],
#		U-boot binaries for armel systems
# 
# Architecture specific build dependencies:
	tofrodos [i386 amd64 kfreebsd-i386 kfreebsd-amd64],
#		For todos, used on files that need to be accessible from
#		DOS.
	mtools [i386 m68k amd64 armhf arm64 kfreebsd-i386 kfreebsd-amd64 hurd-i386],
#		mcopy is used to put files onto FAT filesystems w/o
#		mounting them.
# 
	kmod [linux-any],
#		depmod.
# 
	bf-utf-source [!s390 !s390x],
#		Contains the unicode font we use. Not a udeb since we
#		perform font reduction at build time.
	mkvmlinuz [powerpc],
#		Used to make powerpc images that can boot direct from
#		firmware w/o using a boot loader.
	openssl,
#		Used to encrypt a firmware image so an ARM based device
#		(Thecus N2100) will accept it. Also useful on other
#		architectures if SSL_CERTS has been set locally.
	win32-loader (>= 0.7.2) [i386 amd64 kfreebsd-i386 kfreebsd-amd64 hurd-i386],
#		Alternative boot method for win32 platforms.
	makefs (>= 20100306-5+kbsd8u1~) [kfreebsd-any],

	xorriso (>= 1.3.2-1~) [kfreebsd-i386 kfreebsd-amd64 hurd-i386],
#               Used by grub-pc to create the CD-ROM images
	debian-ports-archive-keyring [sh4 sparc64],
#		Used for architectures hosted on debian-ports.org
	librsvg2-bin [any-amd64 any-i386],
